Validation of Financial datasets to check its integrity and consistency using feature selection that may impact financial analysis and decision-making


# 1-Worked-Example 

**How can we validate financial datasets to ensure their consistency and integrity, using feature selection that may impact financial analysis and decision-making?**


Dataset Used - NYSE and NASDAQ stock prices (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikbearbrown/q2-2023-company-overview-nasdaq-nyse-amex) 


PCA and RFE Recursive Feature Elimination used for Feature Selection for data validation



# 2-Worked-Example 

**Credit Risk Assessment.**


We have a dataset that contains information about individuals, including their age, sex, job, housing situation, savings accounts, checking accounts, credit amount, loan duration, and loan purpose. The objective of this problem is to build a predictive model that can assess the creditworthiness of individuals based on this data.


**Problem Statement**:


 **Identifying Credit Risk in a Financial Dataset**


# Task:


**1- Identify individuals with 'little' or 'no' savings ('Saving accounts' column) who have applied for credit for 'car' or 'radio/TV' purposes ('Purpose' column).**


**2-Calculate the debt-to-equity ratio for each individual based on their 'Credit amount' and 'Duration.' Assume that 'Credit amount' represents debt, and 'Duration' represents the period over which the debt is to be repaid.**


**3- Flag individuals with a debt-to-equity ratio exceeding 1.0 as potential credit risks.**
